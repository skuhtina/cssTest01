<p>Mobile broadband offers the ultimate in online freedom. Sure, any smartphone with a data plan can get online, but laptops and Wi-Fi-only tablets arenâ€™t so fortunate, and tethering isn't always an optimal solution. If you compute on the go and need reliable, ubiquitous web access for all your devices, mobile internet is your best bet.
</p>
<p>Most mobile broadband plans are offered by the same cell phone providers that fuel our smartphones. If you already have cellular service, you can usually buy a mobile hotspot or USB dongle, tack it onto your plan and play around with your data allocation until you find a setup that meets your needs. Conversely, if you're on a prepaid cell phone plan that's affordable but doesn't offer the best service, you might consider starting a separate account with a network that has the all-presence you need. Most good-quality hotspots and USB sticks retail for between $100 and $200, but you can usually get one for free if you're willing to sign up for a two-year contract. (This infomation is not for use.
